#Pierre, Feuille, Ciseaux !

It's a work for my training, which is to create a game: Stone, Leaf or Scissors.

There was a first version where the game was just in JavaScript with prompts and alerts.

I started to improve the game, removing prompts and alerts.

Using a html base and DOM, the game is easier to use.


PS: Sorry if my english is bad !
